# TF2Classic Source Engine

Information from [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)):

Source is a 3D game engine developed by Valve.
It debuted as the successor to GoldSrc with Half-Life: Source in June 2004,
followed by Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 later that year.
Source does not have a concise version numbering scheme; instead, it was released in incremental versions

The repo is based on the TF2 2018 leak. Do NOT use it for any commercial purposes.
